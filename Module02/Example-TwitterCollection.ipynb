    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses specifically on _Twitter_.\n",

    "For most services, we need to register with the platform in order to use their API.\n",
    "Instructions for the registration processes are outlined in each specific section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use APIs because they *can* be much faster than manually copying and pasting data from the web site, APIs provide uniform methods for accessing resources (searching for keywords, places, or dates), and it should conform to the platform's terms of service (important for partnering and publications).\n",
    "Note however that each of these platforms has strict limits on access times: e.g., requests per hour, search history depth, maximum number of items returned per request, and similar."
